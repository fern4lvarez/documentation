# Deploying a Sinatra Application
[Sinatra][sinatra] is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

In this tutorial we're going to show you how to deploy a Sinatra application on
[cloudControl]. You can find the [source code on Github][example-app] and check out the [Ruby buildpack] for supported features.


## The Sinatra App Explained

### Get the App
First, letâ€™s clone the Sinatra App from our repository on Github:
~~~bash
$ git clone git://github.com/cloudControl/ruby-sinatra-example-app.git
$ cd ruby-sinatra-example-app
~~~

Now you have a small but fully functional Sinatra application.

### Dependency Tracking
Sinatra tracks dependencies via [Bundler]. Requirements are read from the `Gemfile` (and `Gemfile.lock`) in the project's root directory. Our simple application depends only on Sinatra:
~~~ruby
source :rubygems
gem 'sinatra'
~~~

Note that there is also the `Gemfile.lock`. When you change the dependencies,
you should run the `bundle install` command to update the `Gemfile.lock`. This file must be in your repository and ensures that all the developers always
use the same versions of all the gems.

### Process Type Definition

cloudControl uses a [Procfile] to know how to start your processes.

The example code already includes a file called `Procfile` at the top level of your repository. It looks like this:
~~~
web: bundle exec ruby server.rb -p $PORT
~~~

Left from the colon we specified the **required** process type called `web` followed by the command that starts the app and listens on the port specified by the environment variable `$PORT`.

## Pushing and Deploying the App
Choose a unique name to replace the `APP_NAME` placeholder for your application and create it on the cloudControl platform: 
~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME create ruby
~~~

Push your code to the application's repository, which triggers the deployment image build process:
~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default push

       Installing rack (1.5.2)
       Installing rack-protection (1.3.2)
       Installing tilt (1.3.3)
       Installing sinatra (1.3.4)
       Using bundler (1.2.1)
       Your bundle is complete! It was installed into ./vendor/bundle
       Cleaning up the bundler cache.
-----> Building image
-----> Uploading image (1020K)
       
To ssh://APP_NAME@cloudcontrolled.com/repository.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
~~~

Last but not least deploy the latest version of the app with the cctrlapp deploy command:
~~~bash
$ cctrlapp APP_NAME/default deploy
~~~

Congratulations, you can now see your Sinatra App running at `http://APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com`.
